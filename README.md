# Hangman Game

This is a the Legend of Zelda themed Word Guess Game (Hangman).

##Instructions

When the game is initiated the user will be present with a word that is related to The Legend of Zelda, and it's letters are replaced with underscores.

The game will take input for the user as long as its a letter key on the keyboard. 

If the input matches a charcter of the hidden word it will replace the underscore with the input. 

If the user input doesnt match the hidden word a life, shown in hearts, will be lost.

The goal of the user is to guess the entire word without the life hitting 0.
